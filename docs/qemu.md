# Getting started with a virtual Open-Channel SSD

To enable fast development and interface tests, one can utilize qemu to expose a virtual open-channel ssd within the virtual machine.

There is two implementations available. One for each revision of the open-channel ssd specification.

## Open-Channel SSD 2.0

Revision 2.0 implementation is available here: [https://github.com/OpenChannelSSD/qemu-nvme](https://github.com/OpenChannelSSD/qemu-nvme)

## Open-Channel SSD 1.2 (deprecated)

Revision 1.2 implementation is available here: [https://github.com/OpenChannelSSD/qemu-nvme/tree/ocssd12](https://github.com/OpenChannelSSD/qemu-nvme/tree/ocssd12)

Note that revision 1.2 is no longer being maintained.

# Kernel

pblk and the LightNVM subsystem will typically not be enabled in your distro kernel so you probably need to compile one. Use the most recent mainline kernel or (better) use the lightnvm subsystem development tree:

   `git clone https://github.com/OpenChannelSSD/linux.git`

The latest work is found in the for-x.x/core branch.

Make sure that the Linux kernel .config file at least includes:

    # For NVMe support
    CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NVME=y
    # For LightNVM support
    CONFIG_NVM=y
    # Expose the /sys/module/lnvm/parameters/configure_debug interface
    CONFIG_NVM_DEBUG=y
    # Target support (required to expose the open-channel SSD as a block device)
    CONFIG_NVM_PBLK=y

Compile the kernel and install using the guide for your distribution.

# Qemu Development Environment

To speed up development, one can pass a kernel image directly to qemu to boot. Example kernel config file is provided in the qemu-nvme repository (/kernel.config). Overwrite .config in the kernel source directory and compile.

The kernel can be passed through to qemu using the following arguments.

    -append "root=/dev/vda1" \
    -kernel "{linux source directory}/arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage"
